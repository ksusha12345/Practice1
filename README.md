My intrest in programming was trigged by my friend's who is a programmer. I found it fantastic how she manages her work and family! Recently we were discussing ways to start my new career, so she introduced me to ADA. It was a great opportunity for me, so I checked the Jump Start and Code Academy to find out if it fits my ability. The more time I spent learning about programming, the more I came to relieze this could be a new serious carrer path. Programming is absolutely a new language for me, and I love its wide range of creativity! 

In five years I see myself as a profesional  programer who enjoys working in a company efficiently and creatively. Part of my career would include meeting new people and using teamwork to develop effective solutions. Also, I see me as a volunteer to people who are beginners to programming.

I am considering it is a privilege to be a part of the Ada comminity because of its diversity and inclusivity. It is  a chance for me to support Ada's mission through my help and respect to every student. There are some ways to help people feel more comfotable and relaxed, so I would organize monthly breakfast or lunch in the class. I have great experience with organizing such events! 

My lesson I learned a while ago is asking for help and advice when I need it. I came to the United States as refugee, so my family and I  needed help to find out the ways to survive. Language barrier, lack of information, and shyness were part of the problem. I lost a lot of time and opportunities by figuring out by myself how to fill out applications  and apply for college. Fortunately, there were many people who helped me to learn that asking is a great way to find help and friends! 


In order to find an answer, I used Google search to find list of HBCUs established to the Reconstruction Era and during Reconstruction. 
I selected the HBCUs in 2010 ans 2015 datas, and found the sum of recipients in both categories (Prior to the Reconstruction Era and During the Reconstruction Era), so I got four numbers.
According to the results, the number of loan recipients prior to the Reconstruction Era 
decresed by 1,665, or 27.59 %.
According to the results, the number of loan recipients during the Reconstruction Era 
decreased by 14,722, or 12.66%.
So, the largest change in number of loan recipients between 2010 and 2015 was in HBCUs prior to the Reconstruction Era.
