My intrest in programming was trigged by my friend's who is a programmer. I found it fantastic how she manages her work and family! Recently we were discussing ways to start my new career, so she introduced me to ADA. It was a great opportunity for me, so I checked the Jump Start and Code Academy to find out if it fits my ability. The more time I spent learning about programming, the more I came to relieze this could be a new serious carrer path. Programming is absolutely a new language for me, and I love its wide range of creativity! 

My intrest in programming was was not forced, but casually was a topic that came up during a  dinner. I was visiting my friend,  and we were discussing ways to begin a new career, luckly her spouse introduced us to ADAI thought it sounded like fun and a great opportunity for me to try something new, so I checked the Jump Start and Code Academy to see if programming fit my personality and learning ability. The more time I spent learning about programming, the more I came to relieze this could be a new serious carrer path..  To me, programming is not just a hobby, I am ready to consistantly self-develop and study programming professionaly. I am also ready to have a more modern life full of the latest technology to create a project that could change the world and the common understanding of things. 

In five years I see myself as a profesional  programer who enjoys working in a large company efficiently and creatively. Part of my carrer would include meeting new people and using teamwork to develop effective solutions.

I am considering it is a privilege to be a part of the Ada comminity because of its diversity and inclusivity. It is  a chance for me to support Ada's mission through my help and respect to every student. There are some ways to help people feel more comfotable and relaxed, so I would organize monthly breakfast or lunch in the class. I have great experience with organizing such events! 

I learned my lesson a while ago. it
